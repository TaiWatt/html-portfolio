<h1>The Best Movies According to Melon</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Toy Story 4</h3>
<p>
    This series is close to my heart but the fourth one especially talks to me about moving on to adulthood and keeping sweet memories in our heart.
</p>

<h3>The Terminal</h3>

<p>
    Reminds me how we should try to be a genuinely good person and pass the love forward.
</p>

<h3>Blue Giant</h3>

<p>
    So much raw emotion and hearty jazz music that speaks to our soul to fly.
